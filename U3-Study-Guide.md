# Unit 3: Study Guide
You should be able to:
* Compare natural & programming languages in general terms and justify (explain) the significant differences.
* Trace simple programs & functions to:
  - Predict output
  - Correct errors (add or remove lines of code)
* Work with functions:
  - How to define & call (recognize the code for each)
  - Choosing good names for functions & their parameters
  - Functions can call other functions
  - Function parameters
    - Why creating parameterized functions is valuable
    - How to define a function with parameters
    - How to call a function with parameters
* Loops:
  - How to write a loop
Predict what will happen when the loop is executed
Predict how many times the loop will iterate
Loops vs. Functions
When to use loops
When to use functions
Abstraction
How do functions lead to higher levels of abstraction
How does abstraction enable programming teams to work more effectively
Top down design (TDD):
Describe the process
Provide examples of TDD, given a simple problem
Explain how TDD helps programers organize their work and develop abstractions.
